# Tips

## Total power tip

During an alliance boss battle, if all heroes are used and the final boss wasn't defeated, then look at the damage ranking - the total damage you did will be your total power.

## Boss challenge hero tip

This works during Harbor, alliance, and kingdom end of level boss battles.

Before starting the boss battle, click on the selected hero.

Click `Sort by Power (descending)`.  At this stage I'd recommend closing the window with the red cross top right, as the ui doesn't always seem to work right on some of these screens.  Then click the hero again.

Choose your _least_ powerful hero then click to fight/auto resolve/whatever.

The reason for this is that in the alliance and harbor battles where you face multiple increasingly tough bosses, if you don't do this you will have "blown" your best hero on the weakest enemy, and much of their power will have been wasted.

In the end of kingdom level boss, it won't change the outcome but if you use ever increasing heros, you will may get a better sense if you are actually going to win - at the last few heros if the boss has more power than those you've got left, you won't defeat them.  

It would prevent you having to grind through multiple small fry heros only to lose anyway.

## Punishment tip

The tip is to wait for every _second_ day to do punishments in the dungeon, just leave them squirming for a whole day in between :wink:.

The way the punishment works is that you start afresh each day at the first prisoner you have, when they are done with them you go to the next one and each one is increasing power and reward.

You daily get "recharged" half of the possible standing which powers your punishment.

So if you use it all up every day, you will get rewards every day, but will only get half way through the prisoners compared to leaving it 2 days to build up full standing - and the later prisoners have great rewards, so you will be better off overall at the expense of having to wait a bit.

## Kingdom missions tip

After chapter 67, where the map part of the story is completed, the missions to fight no longer show up on the map after clicking the [Kingdom](#kingdom) button right of the Castle and City scenes.

To access them, go directly to the Campaign by
*  City scene → Campaign  

## Castles defend requirements tip

When adding a [Hero](#heros) or [Maiden](#maidens) to a castle on it's [defend](#kingdom-castles-defend) tab, it may say that none met the requirements, however they *can* still be assigned by clicking `Confirm` on the dialog.  Despite the text in the dialog, this does not upgrade the castle.  Resource collection may be slower but it's still better than nothing!

A hero and maiden with [matching requirements](#kingdom-castles-defend) will be required to upgrade the castle, but they can be "borrowed" temporarily from another castle to achieve this.

## Castles upgrade tip

TL;DR - *Don't upgrade your kingdom castles!!!*.  Or rather, not until you are certain you have spare capacity to meet at least the new [Hero](#heros) requirements, and preferrable the [Maiden](#maidens) requirements too, or at least you are aware of the risks vs rewards

See the [Castles](#castles) section, and in particular the [Upgrade example](#kingdom-castles-upgrade).

##### Requirements

These are the requirments for the [Hero](#heros) or [Maiden](#maidens) to successfully "Defend" a castle.

When adding a [Hero](#heros) or [Maiden](#maidens) which does not meet the requirements, the game says the rather cryptic:

> Insufficient {Hero/Maiden} attribute, castle revenue will be reduced after settling in, do you want to upgrade the castle?

However they can still be assigned by clicking "Confirm" in response to this question, which *does not* upgrade the castle.  Resource collection may be slower but it's still better than nothing!

##### Accumulations

For [Hero](#heros), the resource collection rate is based on their stats related to the requirements (higher stats, faster rate).  However meeting requirement gives a great boost to the rate (maybe even as high as 3x).

Castle experience is collected at the set rate provided the hero is assigned - they don't even have to be resource collecting.

Similarly, for [Maiden](#maidens), the time to collect the reward is based on their stats related to the requirements (higher stats, quicker collection). The time to collect is also the time between storing rewards if "continue to accumulate" is checked.

#### Explore

#### <a name="kingdom-castles-upgrade"></a> Upgrade

Be wary of upgrading castles "beyond your means".

A higher level castle with unmet requirements will deliver much worse accumulation than a lower level with requirements met.

With requirements met, the increase in accumulation rate is not significant, so bear that in mind as a risk/reward when deciding whether to upgrade.

##### Example:

Starting with Argendale Level 1, Brunhilde as both [Hero](#heros) and [Maiden](#maidens).  She has Int:200,Chm:669 Lvl:200,Atr:1.11M

The castle is accumulating: Exp:300/m Grn:2637/m, 3x100KGrn/h.

Upgrading to Level2 (which cost 55.1M soldiers!), the accumulation has now gone down to: Exp300/m *grn:673/m* 3x100KGrn/h.

The new requirements are Int:111,Chm:141 Lvl:201,Atr:238k.

So [Hero](#heros) Brunhilde is not meeting the Lvl requirement (she's Lvl:200).

Upgrading Brunhilde to level 201, which cost about Gld:4M, accumulations are: Exp300/m *Grn:2664/m* 3x100kGrn/h (store 4)

So paying Sld:55.1M to upgrade the castle from level 1 to level 2 resulted in a reduction of Grain rate from Grn:2637/m to Grn:673/m.

This was probably the least-worst miss of requirements possible, many requirments jumps might be out of reach of the current player state.  But paying for the upgrade meant that the overall transaction was Sld:55.1M and Gld:4M to go from Grn:2637/m to Grn:2664/m.

So upgrading can be quite a big risk of reduction for fairly small gains if successful.

# Items

In the case of [Military Attribute](attributes-military) this mean the [Power](#power) is also increased

### Total power

This is an important metric, as it determines whether you win end of kingdom campaign boss battles.  Although its the total of the power of all your heros, it's not displayed anywhere I've found, but there is a way to find it - see [total power tip](#total-power-tip)

Increases child potential and attributes.

Also unlocks more [Bound hero](#bound-hero) gains.

### Quality

### Power

The sum of heros' power makes up the character [Total power](#total-power), which is crucial in [boss battles](#boss-challenge-hero-tip).

According to the [Ksrgland fandom site](https://ksrgland.fandom.com/wiki/Heroes#Power) the formula for the hero's power is

> Power = (5000 * [Level](#level) * [Military quality](quality-military)) +  [Military attribute](attributes-military)

I was able to verify this, my "Good Sir James" had:
* Power: 4.56M
* Quality: 17
* Level: 100
  * `Devilish Ferocity lv:1  - Military:    +5/level = 5`
  * `Strategic Planning lv:1 - Military:    +4/level = 4`
  * `(Total Military quality= 9)`
  * `Coffer Management lv:1  - Fortune:     +3/level = 3`
  * `Barony Rulership lv:2   - Provisions:  +1/level = 2`
  * `Officers Eloquence lv:1 - Inspiration: +3/level = 3`

`Total Quality = 9 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 17` :heavy_check_mark:

* Attr: 220K
  * Military (gold): 60.3K
  * Fortune: 54K
  * Provisions: 52.2K
  * Inspiration: 53.8K

`Power = (5000 * 100 * 9) + 60300 = 4560300 = 4.56M` :heavy_check_mark:
