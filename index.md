In the case of [Military Attribute](attributes-military) this mean the [Power](#power) is also increased

### Total power

This is an important metric, as it determines whether you win end of kingdom campaign boss battles.  Although its the total of the power of all your heros, it's not displayed anywhere I've found, but there is a way to find it - see [total power tip](#total-power-tip)

## Maidens

### Intimacy

Unlocks "Naughty".

Increases child potential and attributes.

Also unlocks more [Bound hero](#bound-hero) gains.

### Charm

Increasing this increases how much experience is gained for each visit

### Exprience

## Heros

### Attributes

> Total attributes becomes Tourney health (?? verify this ??)

> Total attributes across all characters contributes to Kingdom power (??how??)

#### <a name="attributes-military"></a> Military

### Quality

#### <a name="quality-military"></a> Military

### Power

The sum of heros' power makes up the character [Total power](#total-power), which is crucial in [boss battles](#boss-challenge-hero-tip).

According to the [Ksrgland fandom site](https://ksrgland.fandom.com/wiki/Heroes#Power) the formula for the hero's power is

> Power = (5000 * [Level](#level) * [Military quality](quality-military)) * [Military attribute](attributes-military)

# Tips

## Total power tip

During an alliance boss battle, if all heroes are used and the final boss wasn't defeated, then look at the damage ranking - the total damage you did will be your total power.

## Boss challenge hero tip

This works during Harbor, alliance, and kingdom end of level boss battles.

Before starting the boss battle, click on the selected hero.

Click `Sort by Power (descending)`.  At this stage I'd recommend closing the window with the red cross top right, as the ui doesn't always seem to work right on some of these screens.  Then click the hero again.

Choose your _least_ powerful hero then click to fight/auto resolve/whatever.

The reason for this is that in the alliance and harbor battles where you face multiple increasingly tough bosses, if you don't do this you will have "blown" your best hero on the weakest enemy, and much of their power will have been wasted.

In the end of kingdom level boss, it won't change the outcome but if you use ever increasing heros, you will may get a better sense if you are actually going to win - at the last few heros if the boss has more power than those you've got left, you won't defeat them.  

It would prevent you having to grind through multiple small fry heros only to lose anyway.

## Punishment tip

The tip is to wait for every _second_ day to do punishments in the dungeon, just leave them squirming for a whole day in between :wink:.

The way the punishment works is that you start afresh each day at the first prisoner you have, when they are done with them you go to the next one and each one is increasing power and reward.

You daily get "recharged" half of the possible standing which powers your punishment.

So if you use it all up every day, you will get rewards every day, but will only get half way through the prisoners compared to leaving it 2 days to build up full standing - and the later prisoners have great rewards, so you will be better off overall at the expense of having to wait a bit.

## Kingdom missions tip

After chapter 67, where the map part of the story is completed, the missions to fight no longer show up on the map after clicking the [Kingdom](#kingdom) button right of the Castle and City scenes.

To access them, go directly to the Campaign by
*  City scene → Campaign
