### Total power

This is an important metric, as it determines whether you win end of kingdom campaign boss battles.  Although its the total of the power of all your heros, it's not displayed anywhere I've found, but there is a way to find it.

During the daily harbor or alliance boss battles, if all heroes are used and the final boss is still alive, then look at the damage 
ranking - the total damage will be your total power.
